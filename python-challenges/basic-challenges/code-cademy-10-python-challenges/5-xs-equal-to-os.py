"""
Are the Xs equal to the Os?
Create a Python function that accepts a string.
This function should count the number of Xs and the number of Os in the string.
It should then return a boolean value of either True or False.

If the count of Xs and Os are equal, then the function should return True.
If the count isnâ€™t the same, it should return False. If there are no Xs or Os in the string, it should also return True because 0 equals 0.
The string can contain any type and number of characters.
